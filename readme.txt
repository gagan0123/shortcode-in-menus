Allows you to add shortcodes in WordPress Navigation Menus

== Description ==

Allows you to add shortcodes in WordPress Navigation Menus so that you can 
generate the links dynamically.

To test this, you can add a custom link with a ShortCode [gs_test_shortcode] as link URL, if it points to http://gagan.pro, plugin is working, if not(even any other ShortCode), then please write a new support ticket with ticket with the ShortCode you used and from which plugin/function that ShortCode is from, so that I'll be able to help you better.

PLEASE NOTE: If you want to use a ShortCode that outputs not just the URL, but complete HTML sections, put "FULL HTML OUTPUT" in the "Link Text" option for that link and it will output the complete HTML without breaking your site.

== Installation ==

1. Add the plugin's folder in the WordPress' plugin directory.
